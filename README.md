# UX

## Stakeholder Interview
### **what are the main services of this company:**
<p><em>"Affordable cinematic promotional content for independent and small businesses, either narrative-based, documentary or tutorial content."</em></p>

###	**how does it differ from competitors:**
<p><em>“My background as an actor and my experience from being on film sets and some of the biggest theatre stages in the world allows me to bring the scale of that production rigour to smaller scale projects – industry leading standards for small scale businesses”</em></p>

### **What makes it special:**
<p></em>“my unique experience being on the other side of the camera and being in the clients position makes it easy for me to make them feel comfortable and relaxed. As an actor - I focus on the story they are trying to tell, so that the end product becomes a very personable and relatable narrative driven piece of media that demonstrates the real value of the client”</em></p>

###	**what would give him value by having this product out in the wild:**
<p><em>“have an online platform and online catalogue of resources that a client can easily access and see the quality and standard of work that I do, in addition to bridging the gap between ideas that I am verbally pitching to the client – as these could initially be quite grand, in terms of narrative, relatability and accessibility – having a visual representation would help consolidate ideas and pitches to clients. In addition to giving proof of that such ideas can be made real”</em></p>

### **What would add value to such a service:**
<p><em>“contact details, an faq would be really handy, anything to streamline initial dialogue and answer any questions prior to reaching out to me, other features like a gallery or a playlist of embedded videos would be ideal”</em></p>

## Competitor Review
